2. Populate [restaurants.json](restaurants.json) with content relevant to you.
3. Install [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org)
4. Install [telegram-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/telegram-api) (This will be in a package.json file at some point)
5. In a Terminal window, `cd` to the project folder and then enter `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN='YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' node main.js` where YOUR_BOT_TOKEN is replaced by what you were given by [@TheBotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)
6. Type 'IDK' to your bot.

Demo

You can try out [@IndecisiveBot](https://telegram.me/IndecisiveBot) for yourself, but my restaurants.json might not be useful to you.
